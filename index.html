        <h2>I am passionate about people and creating UX that solves problems. I'm excited to grow as a thought-leader
            and am wired to be a problem solver. I'm resilient, empathetic, and will never back down from a challenge. I
            enjoy connecting with people and organizations that value honesty, thought, and flexibility.

            I wasn't born here but Indy truly is my home. </h2>
